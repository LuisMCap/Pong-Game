# Introduction 

This is a standard Pong Game I built using only OOP.

If you would like to try the game. Clone the repository and run the game.py file inside the src folder

As of right now there is only one gamemode:

 - HUMAN VS HUMAN
 
 I plan on making two more game modes:
 
 - HUMAN VS AI
 - HUMAN VS HUMAN | ADD-ONS
