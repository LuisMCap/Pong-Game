# Introduction  

This is a standard Pong Game I built using only OOP.

If you would like to try the game. Clone the repository and run the game.py file inside the src folder (You need to pip install Pygame first in your environment)

As of right now, there is only one game mode:

 - HUMAN VS HUMAN
 
I plan on making two more game modes:
 
 - HUMAN VS AI
 - HUMAN VS HUMAN | ADD-ONS
